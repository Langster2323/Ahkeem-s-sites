          About the man behind the curtain.......
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>aron Davis has been making signs in Texas for 22 years.  You may not realize it, but you know his work already. It is impossible to drive through Austin and not see his signature signage all over our fine city. As an independent owner and operator, clients speak and deal directly when you call...... </li>
          <li>He answers the phone. </li>
          <li>He has lived and breathed art and music since childhood. He honed his skills by sweeping the shops of geniuses from Houston to San Francisco picking up morsels of knowledge from countless talented artists, tech-heads and sign-makers.</li>
          <li>You will not get held up by an assistant, but you may have to wait until he gets off the stage!
</li>
